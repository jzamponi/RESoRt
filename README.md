# RESoRt


The Radio Emission Star formation Rate (RESoRt) is an astrophysical web module used to compute star formation in local as long as high-redshift galaxies from its synchrotron and free-free radio emission, and vice versa (i.e., computing expected radio fluxes by providing known star formations at fixed frequencies).
 
 The RESoRt numerical code used to compute such astrophysical quantities is fully written in C while the web module is written in PHP along with a HTML & CSS layout, also making use of JS.
 
 This is a project on behalf of the Universidad of Conception (Chile) and the Nordic Institute for Theoretical Physics (NORDITA, Sweden).
