# RESoRt


The Radio Emission Star formation Rate (RESoRt) is an astrophysical web module used to compute star formation in local as long as high-redshift galaxies from its synchrotron and free-free radio emission, and vice versa (i.e., computing expected radio fluxes by providing known star formations at fixed frequencies). This web module is an implementation of the algorithm introduced in Schober et al. (2017) (https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2017MNRAS.468..946S).
 
 The RESoRt's numerical back-end is fully written in C and PHP while the front-end is written in HTML, CSS & JS.
 
 This is a project on behalf of the Universidad of Conception (Chile) and the Nordic Institute for Theoretical Physics (NORDITA, Sweden).
